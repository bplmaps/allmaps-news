The Leventhal Map & Education Center and the American Geographical Society Library were awarded a $350,000 Digital Humanities Advancement Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The award, which supports **technical development** of the Allmaps software ecosystem through August 2026, will also support the creation of a **social infrastructure** for maintaining Allmaps—and other digital humanities tools like it—in the long term.
