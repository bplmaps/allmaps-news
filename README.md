### What's Allmaps?

[Allmaps](https://allmaps.org) is a free and open-source platform for making digital map collections easier to share, use, and explore.

As part of a [Digital Humanities Advancement Grant](https://www.neh.gov/grants/odh/digital-humanities-advancement-grants) (2023-2026), the [Leventhal Map & Education Center](https://leventhalmap.org) (LMEC) and the [American Geographical Society Library](https://uwm.edu/libraries/agsl/) (AGSL) are excited to work alongside a community of open-source software developers to make it easier for map-holding institutions to incorporate Allmaps into their collections. Not only will users and institutions be able to easily georeference maps online, but theyâ€™ll be able to crowdsource, create, and curate their own collections of maps across different collections.
